This is our first real, useful conceptnetwork.
Graph information is in wayne_edges.jsons and wayne_nodes.jsons, both json stream files.
Concepts/names that have been looked at, successfully queried and inserted in the network are in wayne_success_list.jsons, also
a json stream.
Concepts/names that have been looked at but with no results are in wayne_black_list.jsons, also a json stream.
A story of wayne's construciton is in the file construction_story.txt

TO MODIFY THIS NETWORK, MAKE SURE TO HAVE A COPY OF IT
IT IS INTENDED TO GROW, THEREFORE KEEP UPATED THE BLACK_LIST AND SUCCESS_LIST :
-the success_list avoid checking concepts already checked before
-the black_list could be checked another time with different methods.
