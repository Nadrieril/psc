Virgil van Dijk has already scored six times for Celtic this seasonThe defender says his attacking instincts were helped by Johan CruyffHe scored his first goal at Parkhead against Partick Thistle on WednesdayÂ 
Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk has revealed the attacking side of his game was indirectly influenced by the great Johan Cruyff.The Dutchman's talents as a centre-back have led to him being linked with a move to England in the January transfer window with Arsenal reportedly one of his suitors.However, he showed his prowess in the opposition penalty box against Partick Thistle on Wednesday night when he notched his sixth goal of the season - his first of his Hoops career at Parkhead - in the 1-0 home win to ease Celtic three points clear of Inverness at the top of the Scottish Premiership.

    Van Dijk has revealed that his attacking flair is influenced by Holland legend Johan Cruyff (second left)The 23-year-old, who started his career as a youth at Willem II, claimed his sharpness in front of goal was honed as a kid playing on pitches named after Holland's most famous player -although he does not see his future as a striker.'I have never played as a striker regularly or anything but when I was younger I was always the winger or striker,' said the former Groningen player.'We have Johan Cruyff courts in Holland. They're small pitches where you play games of five-a-side.'The level is very high and a lot of professional footballers like to play there as well.'So that's what I did when I was younger and sometimes you can see it a little bit on the pitch.'But I love to defend as well, that's the main thing and the important thing for me.

I just want to win games and be a champion.'
